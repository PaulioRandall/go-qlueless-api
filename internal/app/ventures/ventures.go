// Package ventures collects together the handling of all Venture specific
// requests. Functionality in this package is primarily tested using API tests
// within the /tests directory of this project.
//
// A Venture is an abstract concept synonymous with projects. The word was
// selected as a comprimise between the strict professional perpective of
// work & business and the powerful effectiveness of stories and exploration
// on informal learning, problem solving, and decision making.
//
// The ability to explore and experiment is often missing or with held from
// individuals and teams, yet, it's essential to their success and progression.
// By connecting the sense of adventure and positive feelings it invokes,
// individuals and teams are able to optimise themselves for their environments
// which almost always results in a significant increase in it performance,
// happiness, and active engagement.
